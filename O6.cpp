/*Creating a Simple Calculator
In this example, the user must input two numbers. Then we print the sum by calculating (adding) the two numbers:*/
#include <iostream>

	int x, y;
	int sum;
	cout << "Type a number: ";
	cin >> x;
	cout << "Type another number: ";

	sum = x + y;
	cout << "Sum is: " << sum;
