/*Strings are used for storing text.

A string variable contains a collection of characters surrounded by double quotes
To use strings, you must include an additional header file in the source code, the <string> library:
*/
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  string greeting = "Hello";
  cout << greeting;
  return 0;
}
